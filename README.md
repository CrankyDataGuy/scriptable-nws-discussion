# scriptable-nws-discussion

This script displays the Area Forecast Discussion (AFD) from the National Weather Service, based on the three letter location code (full list is available from https://api.weather.gov/products/types/AFD/locations). Replace my location code "OUN" with yours, and run the script.

Many thanks to the National Weather Service for providing this data to the public.
